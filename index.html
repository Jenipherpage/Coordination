  <h2>MECHANISM FOR IMPULSE TRANSMISSION ALONG THE AXON</h2>
  <p>Mechanism involves the following steps</p>
  
    <p>  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.Polarization of the neurone’s membrane</b><br>
    _Sodium is in high concentration on the outside, whereas potassium is in high concentration on the inside. Cell membranes surround neurones, like any other cell in the body which has a membrane. When a neurone is not stimulated, just sitting with no impulse to carry or transmit, its membrane is said to be polarised. Being polarized means that the electrical charge on the outside of the membrane is positive while the electrical charge on the inside of the membrane is negative (Figure 4.9).

    <p>
      <b>2.The resting potential gives the neurone a break</b><br>
When the neurone is polarised, it is said to be at its resting potential. It remains in this 
state until when the stimulus comes along (that is, when it is stimulated). When action 
potential is initiated, a region of the membrane depolarises. As the result the adjacent 
region becomes depolarised as well (Figure 4.10).
      <img src="Screenshot_20240501-131116.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>3.Action potential</b><br>
Sodium ions move inside the membrane when a stimulus reaches a resting neurone. The 
gated ion channels on the resting neurone’s membrane open suddenly to allow the Na+ 
that was on the outside of the membrane to rush into the cell. While this happens, the 
neurone changes from being polarised to being depolarised. After more positive ions 
enter inside the membrane, the inside becomes positive and polarisation is removed and 
the threshold is reached (Figure 4.11).
      <img src="Screenshot_20240501-133457.jpg">
    </p>
    <p>
      During repolarisation, potassium ions move outside, while sodium ions stay inside the 
membrane. After repolarisation, the inside of the cell becomes flooded with Na+
; the gated 
ion channels on the inside of the membrane open to allow K+
 to move to the outside of 
the membrane. With K+ moving to the outside, the membrane’s repolarisation restores 
electrical balance, although it is the opposite of the initial polarised membrane that had 
Na+
 gates close. Otherwise, the membrane could not repolarize (Figure 4.13). Then Na+
ions are actively forced out of the axoplasm in the process called sodium pump. However, 
since K+
 ions are also involved in this process, the process is best called cation pump

      <h2>MECHANISIM FOR SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION</h2>
      <P> 1.An action potential arrives at the end 
of the axon and induces changes in the 
        cell membrane(figure 4.16)
        <img src="Screenshot_20240501-154149.jpg"    >
      </p>
    <p>
      2.Depolarisation at the synaptic knob after arrival of nerve impulses create the action 
potential which opens voltage-gated calcium channels located near the synapse in 
the presynaptic membrane, thus increasing the permeability of the membrane to 
calcium (Ca2+) ions. The electrochemical gradient for Ca2+ results in the inflow of 
calcium ions through the open channels (Figure 4.17).
      <img src="Screenshot_20240501-155406.jpg">    
    </p>
    <p>
       3.In response to the increase of calcium concentration inside the axon, synaptic vesicles 
fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release neurotransmitters into the gap between 
the cells which is called the synaptic cleft. The delivery of neurotransmitters into the cleft 
is an example of exocytosis (Figure 4.18).
      <img src="Screenshot_20240501-155955.jpg">
    </p>
 
    <p> 4.The vesicles then return to the cytoplasm and are refilled with transmitter substance. 
The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft, a process which takes 0.5ms 
per synapse. Upon reaching the postsynaptic membrane, it binds with receptor 
molecules which recognise the molecular structure of the acetylcholine molecule 
(Figure 4.19).
      <img src="Screenshot_20240501-155955.jpg">
    </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;5.The arrival of acetylcholine at the 
postsynaptic membrane changes 
the shape of the receptor site. This 
initiates ion channels to open up. 
The excitatory synapse which opens 
ion channels on the postsynaptic 
membrane allowing sodium ions to 
enter and potassium ions to leave. This 
creates a new potential known as the
    
    excitatory postsynaptic potential in 
the post synaptic neurone. Once the 
neurotransmitter has depolarised the 
post synaptic neurone, it is hydrolysed 
to form acetyl and choline by the 
enzyme “acetylcholinesterase” which 
is found in the postsynaptic membrane. 
This prevents the successive impulse 
merging at the synapse (Figure 4.20).
    <img src="Screenshot_20240502-090356.jpg">
    
    The resulting acetyl and choline diffuses 
across the synaptic cleft into the synaptic 
knob of the presynaptic neurone where 
they get stored in their vesicles for further 
use. The process is facilitated by energy 
produced by numerous mitochondria 
in the knob. The overall depolarising 
effect of several Excitatory Postsynaptic 
Potential (EPSPs) is called summation. 
When two or more EPSPs simultaneously 
arising at different regions either on the 
same or different neurones, producing 
sufficient depolarisation which can starts 
an action potential in the postsynaptic 
neurone, the phenomenon is known as 
spatial summation.
The excitatory postsynaptic potential 
builds up as more neurotransmitter 
substance arrives until sufficient 
depolarisation occurs to exceed the threshold value and so generate an action 
potential in the postsynaptic neurone, this 
is called temporal summation. All events 
described are for excitatory synapse, 
some known inhibitory synapses respond 
to neurotransmitter by opening potassium 
ion channels and leaving the sodium ion 
channels closed. Potassium, therefore, 
moves out causing the membrane to be 
polarised; consequently, it prevents the 
threshold value to be exceeded. Thus no 
action potential will be created.<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;<b>Functions of synapses</b><br>
(a) They transmit information between 
neurones. The synapses pass 
impulses in one direction only. 
Such impulses are transmitted at the 
presynaptic membrane and received 
by the postsynaptic membrane, which
    ensures one direction of flow along a 
given pathway.<br>
(b) They amplify impulses by 
acetylcholine which is released at a 
neuromuscular junction which excite 
the post synaptic membrane and 
amplifies any weak impulse arriving. 
Repeated low level stimuli can be 
amplified as each impulse is arriving 
at the synapse, causing the release of 
more neurotransmitter, resulting in 
one larger impulse in the postsynaptic 
neurone. Therefore, this allows the 
body to respond to the stimuli more 
effectively.<br>
(c) They act as junctions that transmit 
electric nerve impulses between 
neurones, or between neurone and 
effector cells. A synaptic connection 
between a neurone and muscle cell is 
known as neuromuscular junction.<br>
(d) They filter out low level stimuli; as 
more neurotransmitter diffuses across 
the synaptic cleft, the excitatory 
postsynaptic potential increases. For 
the impulses to be generated in the 
postsynaptic neurone, it must reach 
the action potential of about +40 
mV. This implies that weak impulses 
in the presynaptic neurone do not 
cause enough neurotransmitter to be 
released for an action potential in the 
postsynaptic neurone to be generated. 
As a result, synapses are able to filter 
out low level stimuli that the body 
does not need to respond, that is a way 
of conserving energy. <br>
(e) They allow adaptation to intense 
stimulation and fatigue. The amount 
of transmitted substance which is
   released by synapse steadily falls off 
in a response to a constant stimulation 
until the supply of the transmitted 
substance is exhausted.<br>
(f) They allow convergence, spatial 
summation and integration of the 
stimuli. In convergence of the stimuli, 
the postsynaptic nerves receive 
impulses from a large number of 
excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic 
neurones. In a spatial summation 
postsynaptic neurone is able to sum-
up the stimuli from all presynaptic 
neurones, where the synapse act as a 
centre for the integration of stimuli 
from different sources; hence produces 
the coordinated response.

    <b> MECHANISM OF PHOTORECEPTION</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rods contain light sensitive pigment 
rhodopsin, which is attached to the 
outer surface of vesicles. Rhodopsin is a 
molecule formed by the combination of a 
protein called scotopsin with a small light-
absorbing molecule called retinene which 
is a carotenoid molecule derived from 
vitamin A. When the rhodopsin molecule 
is exposed to bright light, it breaks down 
into retinene and scotopsin. This process 
is called bleaching.
    <img src="Screenshot_20240503-044827.jpg">
Rhodopsin is reformed immediately when 
light stimulation decreases. Trans retinene 
is first converted into cis retinene and then 
recombined with scotopsin. This process 
is called dark adaptation. Similary, the 
cone system has a very high spatial 
resolution but it is relatively insensitive to 
light. It is therefore specialised for acuity 
at the expense of sensitivity. This property 
of the cone system allows us to see colour.

    <br><br>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>MECHANISM OF SEEING</b><br>
      Light rays from the 
object pass from the external part of the 
eye to the retina through the conjunctiva, 
cornea, aqueous humour and pupil 
(Figure 4.30). The pupil is an opening 
(an aperture) which is controlled by the 
iris (like camera shutters) depending 
on the amount of light. The stronger the 
amount of light, the smaller the size of the 
aperture. The lens is positioned between 
the outer and inner chambers of the eye, 
and its major function is to focus images 
on the retina by changing its thickness
      depending on the amount of light from 
distant or nearby objects. On the retina, 
there are cone and rod photoreceptors, 
which are connected to the brain via a 
bundle of fibres called optic nerve. The 
information received is processed in the 
brain, and consequently, the object can
      be seen. Thus, the role of the retina is 
to translate light into nerve signals and 
allow us to see under various conditions 
ranging from starlight to sunlight. It also 
distinguishes the wavelengths for us to 
discriminate colors.

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>MECHANISM OF HEARING</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mammalian ear functions as an organ 
for hearing and balance. The process 
of hearing starts when sound waves 
enter the outer ear and travel through 
the external auditory canal until they 
reach the tympanic membrane, causing 
the membrane and the attached chain of 
auditory ossicles to vibrate. The malleus 
then takes the pressure from the inner 
surface of the tympanic membrane and 
passes it by means of the incus to the stapes. 
There are about 20 times multiplication of 
sound pressure as it moves from outside 
      to inner ear.
      The motion of the stapes against the oval 
window sets up waves in the fluids of the 
cochlea, causing the basilar membrane to 
vibrate. This stimulates the sensory hair 
cells of the organ of corti, on the basilar 
membrane, to send nerve impulses to the 
brain. When they reach the auditory area 
of the cerebral cortex, they are interpreted 
as a sound. Many sensory hair cells with 
different thresholds at which they are 
stimulated exist. The louder the sound, the 
greater the number of sensory hair cells 
will be stimulated at any one point of the 
basilar membrane (Figure 4.33).

      <b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MECHANISM OF MAINTANING BODY BALANCE IN MAMMALS</b><br>
The parts of the ear which are concerned 
with balance are the semicircular canals 
and vestibule. The semi circular canals are 
three curved tubes containing endolymph, 
which communicates with the middle 
chamber of the cochlea via the utriculus 
and sacculus. Each of the three canals is 
set in a plane at right angles to the other. 
Any movement in any plane will cause 
movement of canals in the direction of the 
head. Each of the three canals possesses a 
swollen portion, the ampulla, within which 
there is a flat gelatinous plate, the cupula. 
The movement of endolymph displaces 
the cupula in the opposite direction to 
the head movement. The sensory hair 
found at the base of the cupula detects 
the displacement and sends impulse to 
the brain through the vestibular nerve.
      The brain then initiates motor impulses to 
various muscles to correct the imbalance 
(Figure 4.34).
All information that aid balance and 
positioning of the body relative to 
gravity, as well as changes in the position 
due to acceleration and deceleration is 
provided by utriculus and sacculus. Such 
information is provided by granules 
known as otoliths which are embedded 
in jellylike materials. Various movements 
of the head cause this otolith to displace 
sensory hair cells on the regions of the 
walls of utriculus and sacculus which 
respond to vertical and lateral movements 
respectively. Then the sensory hair cells 
send appropriate sensory impulse to the 
brain.
